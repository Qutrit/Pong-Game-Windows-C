# Pong-Game-Windows-C++
Pong written in C++. Includes an AI.

To run the game you need Microsoft Visual Studios or some other compiler. From there, you can
compile the code and run it. The game runs on Window's command prompt. 

This is one of the first things I programmed a while ago. 
It's a bit CPU intensive and the arrow keys have a lag when held down because of the command prompt. 
You can fix the lag with some assembly language because the lag is from the command prompt itself. 
You're welcome to take the code and improve it or make it your own, but I'm really busy so I don't think 
I'll have time to look at any updates. Also, you must keep it open source.
